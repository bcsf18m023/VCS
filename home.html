        <p>Then we create a file in our initialized folder using <strong>"Touch"</strong>command. The created file is added in the stagging area using <strong>Add</strong> command. After that we execute <strong>Commit</strong> command to make the changes permanent.</p>

        <p>In order to connect our local repositery to central repositry available on web we need to create a repository on our github account. After that name your repositery and create it.</p>

        <p>If we want to check all the versions of files commited earlier we can use <strong>Log</strong> command.</p>
